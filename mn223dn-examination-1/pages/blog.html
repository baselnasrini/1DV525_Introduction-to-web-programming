                <h3>Why is it important to seperate the layout and design (css) from content (html)?</h3>

            <section class = "article_body">
                <p>HTML is the site structure and CSS is the site design. Separating CSS from html makes the code 
                    more understandable and is very useful especially when it comes to maintain or rebuild the site 
                    project.</p>

                <p>Open graph protocol enables the site to has a rich object with the same functionality
                    of the other object when the site is being shared on other websites like facebook or twitter. 
                    One can do it simply by using metadata in the head section of the page code: One can specifie 
                    the titlle, site type, image, URL, description.</p>

                <p>humans.txt is a text file located in the root of the website domain that contains information

                    includes also the techniques, tools and components used in the site development. It can also

                <p>It's Robots exclusion standard which is simply a text file (robots.txt) that is located in 
                    the root of the website domain. The protocol specifies places that are not allowed to web 
                    crawlers or the other web robots to read or to process. In the file we specifie the 
                    "User-agent" which is the robot and we can use "*" that applies for all robots. 
                    And "Disallow: " to define which pages the robots should not visit. In this assignment I 
                    used "Disallow: /contact.html" to prevent the contact page of being indexed by the search 
                    engines</p>
